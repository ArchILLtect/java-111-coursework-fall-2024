-------------------

After each line identify who it is from this list.
The first one is already done!:
    -Class
    -Method
    -Object
    -Instance variables.


I am compiled from a .java file.
    -Class


My instance variable values can be different from my buddy's values.
    -Object

I like to do stuff.
    -Method


I can have many methods.
    -Class

I live on the heap.
    -Object

I am used to create object instances.
    -Class
